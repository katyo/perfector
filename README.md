# Perfector

This is an experimental declarative parametric programmatic mechanical CAD written in Rust using OpenCASCADE BRep kernel.

Also this is my ~~second~~ ~~third~~ four attempt make things right. *Damn shit.*

**Warning:** Current state is work in progress, almost all featuares is in early stage and cannot be used in any form.
